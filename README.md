# Real-Hero — Project notes

This repository contains the Real-Hero blood donation platform (frontend + backend).

Run locally
1. Backend
   - cd backend
   - copy `.env.example` -> `.env` and set keys
   - npm install
   - npm run dev

2. Frontend
   - cd frontend
   - npm install
   - npm start

If you need the MediBot AI features re-added (chat, image analysis, nearby places), ask and I can reintroduce them as a new, controlled feature branch.
